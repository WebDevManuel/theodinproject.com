    <h1>Bruschetta with pot pesto</h1>
    <img src="../images/bruschetta.jpg" alt="bruschetta" width="300">
    <p style="width: 450px;">This light and tasty starter is easy to make and a real crowd pleaser! If you have a spare, sunny day a Bruschetta is a perfect snack in the sun.</p>
    <p style="width: 450px;">The sharp and savoury tastes of the Bruschetta with a THC rich pot pesto is complemented well by the terpene profiles of Auto Lemon Kix and Skywalker Haze.</p>
    <p style="width: 450px;">The terpene profile of Auto Lemon Kix (shown below) provides some spicy flavours thanks to the high levels and combination of Terpinolene, Beta-Myrcene and Beta-Caryophyllene. Limonene and Ocimene help provide a fruity and citrus element to the terpene profile which fits well with this flavoursome dish.</p>
    <p style="width: 450px;">By adjusting the strength of your THC infused olive oil you can vary the potency of the dish. Note that the psychoactive high can take a couple of hours to take effect with a cannabis edible, be careful not to keep eating and over-consume!</p>
    <p style="width: 450px;">To make THC infused olive oil just leave some buds soaking in olive oil for a day or two. You will also need to apply some heat to the THC infused olive oil to convert the non-psychoactive  THC-A into the psychoactive form THC. This takes around 30-40 minutes at 100ºC (220ºF).</p>
    <p style="width: 450px;">This dish serves a couple of people and takes about 45 minutes to make.</p>

    <h3>Step-by-step guide:</h3>
    <ol style="width: 450px;">
        <li>Preheat your oven to around 180ºC / 350°F.</li>
        <li>To make the pesto, warm a small pan over medium heat to toast your walnuts, stirring for 3-4 minutes. Then remove from the heat and allow to cool.</li>
        <li>Remove the flaky skins of the walnuts by rubbing them over a metal sieve or strainer.</li>
        <li>Use a food processor to grind the walnuts into a rough flour.</li>
        <li>Wash and dry the basil, remove the stems and shred the leaves into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Add the basil, garlic, salt, and Parmesan to the walnut flour in the food processor.</li>
        <li>While the processor is running, add ¾ cup of the THC olive oil.</li>
        <li>Add more salt or oil until you are happy with the texture.</li>
        <li>To make the bruschetta brush your bread slices with THC olive oil, then toast in the oven for 3 minutes on a tray until they are golden.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, and top each bread slice with the diced tomatoes, then return the budschetta to the oven for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove, top with the pesto and enjoy your dish!</li>
