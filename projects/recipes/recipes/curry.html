    <h1>Coconut curry infused with cannabis</h1>
    <img src="../images/curry.jpg" alt="curry" width="300">
    <p style="width: 450px;">An aniseed coconut curry is arguably one of the tastiest vegetarian curry recipes. It’s a filling meal with a light creamy texture and a tropical coconut taste.</p>
    <p style="width: 450px;">You can add extra chilli to give it the perfect level of warmth if you prefer a hot curry. THC is supplied via a coconut oil infusion, it’s up to you to decide how strong you wish to make this. One easy method is to add warm decarboxylated cannabis oil to warm coconut oil and mix them together well.</p>
    <p style="width: 450px;">Durban Poison and Auto Xtreme seem to be the best matched cannabis strains for this dish. Durban Poison often has hints of aniseed and pepper to the aroma and this really brings the dish alive. The Durban Poison aniseed taste in particular is perfectly matched to this aniseed coconut curry.</p>
    <p style="width: 450px;">Auto Xtreme is also a spicy flavour-packed strain with high levels of pinene giving it a fresh taste, complemented by Linalool, Beta Myrcene and Beta-Caryophyllene.</p>
    <p style="width: 450px;">The following curry serves about 6 people and takes an hour to prepare.</p>

        <li>1 cup of chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cumin seeds</li>

        <li>Warm the infused coconut oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the coriander and cumin seeds and toast them until brown. Add the chopped garlic and allow to cook until browned.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, ginger, turmeric, and salt to the pot and allow to cook for about 5-6 minutes. This should be stirred occasionally. Then add the lentils, the cayenne powder, and 3 cups of water.</li>
