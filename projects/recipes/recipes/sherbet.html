    <p style="width: 450px;">Who doesn't enjoy a sweet treat after a great meal? Our Canna-Berry Sherbet is a great vegan dessert, it serves a couple of people and takes about 20-30 minutes to make. It’s a perfect end to a great canna meal. As always it’s important to point out that it can take a couple of hours until the psychoactive effects of edible cannabis are felt. So eat with caution and understand the THC levels that work best for you.</p>
    <p style="width: 450px;">Auto Blackberry Kush and Bubba Island Kush are two full-flavoured indica strains that provide some complex and fruity aromas that complement this dessert particularly well. Both can deliver sweet dark-fruit flavours which add real depth.</p>
